

First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor Patrick Eriksson for his
supervision and guidance during these first two-and-a-half years of my research.
For sharing his knowledge on remote sensing and radiative transfer as well as
reminding me that there is more to remote sensing than just the Mathematics.

David Duncan, my co-supervisor, for his advice and inspiring discussions on
remote sensing, atmospheric processes and beyond. For long runs and even longer
bike rides.\\[0.1cm]

Prof. Stefan A. Buehler, Dr. Manfred Brath and Oliver Lemke from the University
of Hamburg for the collaboration on ARTS as well as for always finding some
space for me when I am in Hamburg.\\[0.1cm]

My present and former colleagues from the Division of Microwave and Optical
Remote Sensing for their continuous feedback and support. Especially, I would
like to thank Donal Murtagh, Vasileios Barlakas, Robin Ekelund and of course
Patrick Eriksson for reading through this thesis and providing valuable feedback
even on short notice.\\[0.1cm]

Julia Kukulies for her feedback on this thesis and the courage required to
